# CredentialChain

## Project Overview
CredentialChain is a revolutionary decentralized credential evolution system built on the Stacks blockchain that transforms how academic and professional credentials are verified, updated, and managed. By leveraging Bitcoin's security through Stacks, it creates an immutable, dynamic record of academic achievements that evolves with continued learning and experience.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Dynamic Credential Evolution**: Credentials that automatically update based on verified achievements and experiences
- **Multi-Party Verification**: Distributed verification system involving educational institutions, employers, and peer reviewers
- **Skill Progression Tracking**: Granular tracking of individual skills with blockchain-verified progression
- **Bitcoin-Secured Records**: Leveraging Stacks' Bitcoin anchoring for immutable credential records
- **Smart Contract-Based Upgrades**: Automated credential upgrades based on verified achievements

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
The system consists of three main Clarity smart contracts:

1. **CredentialRegistry.clar**
   - Manages credential types and standards
   - Handles credential issuance and updates
   - Controls verification authority management

2. **SkillProgression.clar**
   - Tracks individual skill development
   - Manages point accumulation and verification
   - Handles skill level progression

3. **VerificationProtocol.clar**
   - Implements multi-party verification logic
   - Manages verifier credentials
   - Controls verification threshold mechanisms

### Data Models

```clarity
;; Credential Type Structure
{
  credential-id: uint,
  name: string-ascii,
  level: uint,
  required-points: uint,
  verification-requirements: {
    min-verifiers: uint,
    verifier-types: (list 10 principal)
  }
}

;; User Credential Structure
{
  user: principal,
  credentials: (list 100 {
    credential-id: uint,
    current-level: uint,
    points: uint,
    last-updated: uint,
    verifications: (list 10 principal)
  })
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks Wallet (Hiro or similar)
- Clarinet for smart contract development
- Node.js and npm for frontend development

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adenikeakan/credential-chain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local development environment
npm run dev
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
```bash
# Build contracts
clarinet build

# Test contracts
clarinet test

# Deploy to testnet
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```

## 🔍 Core Functions

### Credential Management
```clarity
(define-public (add-credential-type 
    (id uint) 
    (name (string-ascii 50)) 
    (level uint) 
    (required-points uint))
  ;; Creates new credential types with verification requirements
)

(define-public (update-credential 
    (user principal) 
    (credential-id uint) 
    (points uint))
  ;; Updates credential status based on verified achievements
)
```

### Verification Protocol
```clarity
(define-public (verify-achievement 
    (user principal) 
    (achievement-id uint) 
    (verifier principal))
  ;; Handles achievement verification by authorized parties
)

(define-public (check-upgrade-eligibility 
    (user principal) 
    (credential-id uint))
  ;; Checks if a credential is eligible for upgrade
)
```

## 📊 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for all smart contract functions
- Integration tests for credential evolution
- Verification protocol testing
- Frontend component testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:credentials
```
